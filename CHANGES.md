# Development Changelog

This is a retroactive architectural development log. It records significant
semantic decisions and milestones rather than individual commits.

## 2026-09

### Semantic identity model

- Established the semantic graph as the canonical program representation.
- Defined semantic values as the fundamental meaningful units of the model.
- Separated EntityID, VersionID, StateID, and runtime identity.
- Distinguished identity from semantic equality.
- Made semantic states immutable.
- Defined StateID from exact semantic state content rather than history,
  provenance, or transformation mappings.
- Added canonical serialization as the basis for semantic identity.
- Made references state-relative and version-pinned.
- Added explicit cross-state reference transfer.
- Added explicit entity mappings for identity continuity across transformations.
- Separated transformation mappings and provenance from state identity.
- Distinguished explicit rebinding from identity-preserving reference transfer.

### Semantic transformations

- Established transformations as functions producing new immutable states.
- Allowed explicit identity mappings across transformations.
- Allowed identity continuity to represent renaming and other structural
  transformations without implying semantic equality.
- Established explicit produce-versus-activate semantics as a design direction.

### Immutability

- Made semantic values immutable through canonicalized content.
- Made state value collections immutable.
- Established immutable replacement rather than implicit mutation as the default
  state evolution mechanism.

### Testing and executable model

- Established the Python implementation as the executable semantic reference
  model.
- Added tests for identity, equality, references, state identity,
  transformations, canonical serialization, and immutability.
- Added GitHub Actions validation for the semantic model.

### Ownership

- Began separating ownership from ordinary semantic references.
- Ownership is treated as a semantic state relation.
- Ownership is directional and forms a forest.
- An entity may have at most one owner.
- Ordinary references may form arbitrary cycles independently of ownership.
- Destruction is defined as an immutable state transformation recursively
  removing an owned subtree.

## Future

Architectural decisions will be added here when they become sufficiently
stable to form part of the SEMIROH semantic model.
